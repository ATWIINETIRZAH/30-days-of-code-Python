# Data Analysis Project

This project is part of a 30-day Python coding challenge focusing on data analysis. In this project, we will analyze a dataset using Python's pandas library to gain insights and visualize the data.

### Getting Started

### Project Structure

- **data/**: Directory to store the dataset(s) used in the analysis.
- **notebooks/**: Directory to store Jupyter Notebooks for the analysis.
- **results/**: Directory to store any results or output generated from the analysis.
- **scripts/**: Directory to store any Python scripts used in the analysis.

### Analysis Steps

1. **Import and Explore the Data**: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and explore its structure and contents.
2. **Clean and Prepare the Data**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and convert data types if necessary.
3. **Analyzing the Data**: Perform basic statistical analysis and create visualizations to explore relationships in the data.
4. **Advanced Analysis**: Perform more advanced analysis, such as correlation analysis or regression.
5. **Documenting Your Process**: Document your process, including any challenges faced and how you overcame them.

### Conclusion

Data analysis is a crucial skill in today's data-driven world. This project will help practice data analysis skills using Python and pandas.
